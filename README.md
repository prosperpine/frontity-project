# frontity-project

This project was bootstrapped with [Frontity](https://frontity.org/).

I made this page for a friend of mine and I used Frontity for the first time! Frontity is React + Wordpress! Frontity makes it easier to build your application with React and connect it to your Wordpress content. 
Frontity is quite new and although it's easy peasy to get started, the styling was a bit harder than usual since you have to now how to access the different parts of content coming from Wordpress. 

It got a fairly basic blog-styling but I'm pleased with it for a first try and I'm happy to have built a page with a CMS.
